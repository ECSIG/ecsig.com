  <h2>Meeting Places</h2>

  <div>
    <h3><a href="http://ecsig.com/chat">The Chatroom</a></h3>
    The chatroom is where we can most easily be found.
    We host a mibbit web client that can direct you to the chat,
    or you can use one of any number of IRC clients to connect to the server irc.ecsig.com (port 6667 or 6697[SSL]).

  <div>
    <h3><a href="http://forums.ecsig.com">The Forums</a></h3>
    The Forums are a list of our more stable, slower running conversations.
    Most importantly, it's where we store the conversations we want to keep track of.
    We use the forums to maintain the minutes for our meetings.

    <h3><a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114325960134913602780">ECSIG on G+</a></h3>
    Our G+ community is a similar idea to our forums and a foray into our social networking measures.
    The community is currently private (with no way to switch it at the moment!) so if you would like access, please let one of the G+ moderators know.
