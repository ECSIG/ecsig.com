#ECSIG Presentations
Members often volunteer to give presentations during our weekly
meetings.  These presentations typically take place in Tyler Hall room
052, or in one of the computer labs if we don't fit in 052.  All of
our slides are archived on the [ECSIG Github][github].

#Events
Occasionally we'll hold larger events which typically involve more
group members, and may require a bit of preparation for
participants. Events are marked in the list below.
